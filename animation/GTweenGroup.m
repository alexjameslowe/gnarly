//The basic structure of this animation library is the GTweenGroup (hereafter "Group").
//A Group includes a set of tweens which are all running at the same time. Like an object animating its x,y coordinates while it's opacity fades to zero.
//These tweens
//
//The main thing is that
//

//For the decrement function
//Meditate upon this point: We can have groups within groups within groups nested down to an arbitrary level.
//Now, imagine that during the course of animation, within one of these nested structures, the last tween object in a
//particular group has ended. That may not seem to be of any consequence. But what if its parent group is the last
//element among its siblings? Furthermore, what if IT'S parent group is the last among its siblings? What if every
//single one of the parent groups of that tween is the last among its siblings right up to the root level?
//
//  [group]
//      [group]
//          [group]
//
//              [group]
//              [/group]
//
//              [group]
//              [/group]
//
//          [/group]
//
//          [group]
//
//              [group]
//              [/group]
//
//              [group]
//
//              [Tween A]
//              [Tween B]
//              [Tween C]
//
//              [/group]
//
//          [/group]
//      [/group]
//  [/group]
//
//  So here we see that Tween C is the last tween in this big structure. It's the last tween of the last sub-group of the last sub-group
//  etc. etc. all the way to the root.
//
//  This "Tween C" is special, because if this big group structure has a structure that's supposed to fire sequentially AFTERWARDS, then
//  Tween C is last one, and that's the tween with which we will perform the surgery to join the next sequential group into the
//  animation chain.
//
//  Now you might think to yourself- "hey Alex, why don't you just have empty objects which signify the starting and closing of a group?
//  If a group has a sequential tween, then why don't you just have group object representations in the chain of animations? That way, the
//  group object itself would trigger the next group." See, there would end up being ALOT of these empty group objects, and they would
//  take up ALOT of space in the animation chain. The animation loop would spend unacceptably large amounts of time cranking through
//  grouping placeholders. For that reason, the animation chain is made up of only GTween objects.
//
//  So now you know the lay of the land. You know why the last tween of any group is significant. So, meditating on this issue of the last
//  tween, the critical idea is that if a tween ends, we can't release it without due consideration, ##because it has business with the
//  higher levels of grouping##. The last tween MAY be called upon to facilitate a surgery to bring a sequential tween structure into
//  the fold. It can't do that job if we destroy it too soon. Keep these thoughts in mind as you read further in this function.


// So when you have mixed commands of "add in parallel", "add in sequence" what can you expect to see in your animation?
//
// 0.0 - 0.1 - 0.2
//              |
//               --1.0
//                 |
//                  -- 2.0
//
// The above is analogous to the listing:
// append 0.0 in parallel.
// append 0.1 in parallel.
// append 0.2 in parallel.
// append 1.0 in sequence.
// append 2.0 in sequence.
//
// But now what happens if we add a new tween in parallel? the question we have is- "well, parallel to what?"
//
//
// 0.0 - 0.1 - 0.2 - ##0.3##
//              |
//               --1.0
//                 |
//                  -- 2.0
//
// If you add 0.3 in parallel, it joins the "root" parallel branch. fine, but what if you want it to be in parallel with 2.0?
// In that case, make another subgroup of course!
//
// append 0.0 in parallel.
// append 0.1 in parallel.
// append 0.2 in parallel.
// append 1.0 in sequence.
//
// append subgroup. start subgroup.
//     append in parallel: 2.0
//     append in parallel: 2.1
//     append in parallel: 2.2
// end subgroup.
//
// and the listing would look like:
//
// 0.0 - 0.1 - 0.2
//              |
//               --1.0
//                 |
//                  -- 2.0 - 2.1 - 2.2
//

//  TODO.
//  I still don't have a very good hold on how to reuse a tween structure. It's sort of a one-way-trip.
//  when a tween ends, it excises itself from the chain, and after a while the structure is peppered with
//  tweens that are out-of-chain. We would have to do something where it stores the tweens and groups on separate chains
//  and then when you want to reuse an animation structure, it blasts through the whole animation structure and resets
//  everything. that's the only way. it will have to have an alternate set of links- "permanent links". the prev/nextSibling
//  references changes, but then we need a set of 'permanent' perm_prevSibling/perm_nextSibling links.

/**
 Thought Experiment 1: Three groups. A B C. A and C are long. B is short. So B ends first. When the last tween of B ends, the tween boundaries of A and C have to shake hands? When does this happen?
 
 Answer: It happens when the last tween of B ends. This code fires:
 
 if(twnJustEnded) {
 
     //maintain [prev/next]Sibling links, [first/last]ParallelTween
     [self chain_maintainTweenPrevNextSiblings:twnJustEnded];
     
     //maintain the [prev/next]Tween links
     [self chain_maintainTweenPrevNextTweens:twnJustEnded];
     
And the chain_maintainTweenPrevNextTweens performs that handshake. So before the Group B is even sent through the rectify process, the tween boundaries of A and C are joined.
 
 
 Thought Experiment 2:
 
 We have an animation structure
 
  A
    B /B
    C /C
    D /D
 /A
 
 Groups B C D are nested in A. B C D are sequentially connected. So, how does the handshake happen between the inner B,C,D and the boundary of A? See, the B C D are *sequential* so that means that only one of them is "in play" at a time. So that means that when B is done, C is the new first-group/last-group which triggers a refresh of the contours. And when C is done, D is the new first-group/last-group which triggers a refresh of the contours. And the contour refreshing performs the handshake.
